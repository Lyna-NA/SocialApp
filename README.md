# SocialApp | Node.js Social Media REST API with MongoDb  

- Built a real-world social media app REST API with login, register, and all CRUD operations using MongoDB models with Node.js routers:  
  * Designed and developed RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express for handling HTTP requests and responses.  
  * Implemented user authentication and authorization functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).  
  * Created MongoDB models and schemas for storing user information and social media posts.  
  * Handled CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for users and social media posts using Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool.  

- Implemented the UI with HTML and CSS:  
  * Created the UI design for the social media app using pure HTML and CSS.  
  * Separated the CSS files for each React component to support usability and improve maintainability.  
  
- Utilized React Hooks, Context API, and Functional React Components on the front-end:  
  * Used React Hooks to add state and lifecycle methods to functional components.  
  * Implemented the Context API to manage global state across multiple components.  
  * Created functional components for handling different UI elements such as navigation, profile, and posts.  
  
- Utilized Node.js REST API, Axios, and Socket.io for real-time chat functionality:  
  * Used Node.js and Express to create a REST API for handling real-time chat messages.  
  * Utilized Axios for making HTTP requests to the API endpoints.  
  * Implemented Socket.io to enable real-time chat communication between users.  
  
- Stored data in MongoDB Atlas DB:  
  * Created a database in MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-hosted MongoDB service.  
  * Stored user information and social media posts in the MongoDB Atlas database.  
  * Utilized Mongoose to establish a connection between Node.js and MongoDB Atlas for data retrieval and storage.
